
  Friends and Rivals v0.7 Bloodmoon and Havish Travel

This patch was done partly to show how easy it is to incorporate the transport system into other plugins, and partly because I had so much fun with the Havish mod that I'd gladly support it. 

Since you need Bloodmoon for Havish and the main FnR esp is no longer dependant on Bloodmoon to run, this patch includes support for Bloodmoon travel. With this, you do not need the separate Bloodmoon Travel addon.

I tried to script this consistent with what appeared to me to be JOG's original intent in travel; you pretty much get as much mobility as any player without Friends and Rivals, including in those areas where teleports are disabled. When you finish the appropriate quest, you can travel freely, even from other parts of Morrowind back to Havish. 

To install, just unzip to Morrowind/Data Files with the main .esp and check the box next to it.
