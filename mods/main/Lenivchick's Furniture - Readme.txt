How to play

For relatively small objects:
Just take them to inventory as any normal items. You can place them back into the world, or sell them.

For large objects and containers:
Buy Porter's Gloves from Arrille in Seyda Neen.
Equip them. Especially right one.
You should see message box where you can enable placement mode.
Activate object.
Select "Take"

BEWARE!!! If you'll take container with items inside - those items are destroyed for good. You are warned!




Furniture objects supported:

Static:
	Stool 2

Containers:
	Chest 2 (all variants)
	Cloth Sack (all variants)
	Sack (all variants)

Lights:
	Candles 7 (Three candles in one object)
	Lantern 3 (Orangy square lantern)
	Lantern 8 (Blue square lantern)

More will be added in later versions.




Compatibility

OpenMW works for sure. Everything else - should work too. If your mod changes static objects listed above, or attaches scripts to vanilla containers - it probably will crash and burn.




How to install

Put "ZZZ C000 Lenivchick's Furniture.esp" plugin in your "Data Files" folder and enable it.




And by the way, that "ZZZ" letters in plugin's names have nothing to do with russia's symbol for "I support war crimes and genocide". It's just a way to ensure Android version of OpenMW loads my plugins in correct order and you don't need to rearrange them manually. I recommend all the modders to name their plugins this way. Glory to Ukraine!
