Before installing this verion:  Most of you probably know this by now, but I didn't want anyone to say they weren't warned.  In most cases, I haven't had ill effects from simply overwriting the patch and loading a game with a crowd of FnR NPC's, though I've had one save file permanently corrupted, so you might want to take precautions against doubling and data corruption.

Before you unzip this version and overwrite your current esp, load up your save(s) and get to a cell with no FnR NPC's in it, leaving whatever party members you have behind. Then you can safely proceed with installing the new version.

If you have Bloodmoon installed and still want mystic party members to carry you back and forth, check the Bloodmoon travel addon.

If you use the Havish patchlet from the last release, be sure to uncheck that in the Data Files and check the BM-Havish addon instead. It won't be necessary, so you won't miss it if you chose to delete it.

Have fun, and as usual please sent me bug reports, requests and ideas.
