CM Partners - Creature Activation Control V1.1.1
=========================================

This is an add-on for CM Partners (works for Baron's Partners too).

It modifies the beastscript which is attached to all creatures provided by CM Partners.
Your creatures are now controllable by just activating and selecting a choice in the messagebox window instead of by using the dialogue. This method is way faster (especially when the player is a vampire and is using Cortex's Vampire Embrace mod ).
The choices in the messagebox window are : "Follow", "Wait", "Wander" & "...nevermind..."
You are able to acces direct companion share by activating your creature while sneaking.

Version History:

v1.1.1
- Your creatures can now gain health per player level instead of having a fixed 150 of it. Use the new "Train" option in the "Command" submenu to raise your
creature's health. The formula is Creature Health = 20 * Player Level

note:: 
- You cannot abuse the "Train" command to restore your health, I made sure of that.
- Again you may encounter harmless warnings when updating due the increasal of variables in beastScript.

v1.1
- Anytime you acces the messagebox menu the creatures current health is displayed an the bottom of the screen
- the option "commands" is now available, giving further options like "Stay outside" and "Follow inside"
- creatures now won't teleport while the player has weapon/spell ready -  This prevents them from teleporting to you when the combat target is far away.
