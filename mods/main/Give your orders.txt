Give your orders mod v1.3 by TheLys
-----------------------------------------

* Tribunal required *

-----------------------------------------

Install : Just unarchive in the "morrowind\data files" folder


-----------------------------------------

Based on Dracandros' voice mod idea, by Dracandros, which can be found
at Morrowind Summit, http://www.rpgplanet.com/morrowind/

Dracandros gave me permission to use his concepts and ideas. Extra big thanks to him :)

-----------------------------------------

This mod is NOT a replacement for the Dracandro's voice mod, but rather a complement, adding stuff not managed by the Dracandro's voice mod. It doesn't include its unique features, like duels, missions, etc.

My mod adds a topic to dialogs, "-  Give your orders", depending on the person your talk to. This topic gives some options allowing you to make requests or give orders to some NPC based on the relation between you and them.

You can give follow/stay/wander (and sometimes others) orders to :
- any lower rank member of all factions you're part of
- any slave you own. All standard slave will share his inventory with you while obeying your commands, and you can choose to free him at anytime. The share feature doesn't work with slaves having with their own script (like Jessica)
- your companions (those with the Tribunal "companion share" option)
- all person who likes you very much (disp >= 95)

BEWARE, all dialog command will make the NPC react, and that reaction can go up to fighting if you're too rude.
Asking again and again IS rude. :)

Followers are any NPC you succesfully give the order to follow you. 
Detailed list of followers abilities with "Give your Orders 1.3" mod activated : 

- follow/wait/wander commands 
- stats, skills and level display 
- when in following mode, speed boost and fast swim to catch with the player 
- slow regeneration, slowfall, jump boost 
- levitate/waterwalk spells can be activated via dialogue option but only if the player is himself in levitate/waterwalk 


Slaves have all of the above features plus the following ones ("normal" slaves only, using the original "slaveScript" script) : 

Some of these features are based on the cleaver "smart AI" companion scripts by Grumpy, tuned by myself. 

- auto levitate/waterwalk/invisible/chameleon/sneak like the player 
- precise following (well, as much as possible with this engine ) 
- auto warping near the PC if the slave is far away too long 
- level-up with the PC with stats and skills change (however level number itself doesn't change) 
- companion sharing 
- complete stats/skills/level display anytime 




Some hints :

- Have a VERY careful look at the disposition value in the dialog box, it's VERY important for giving orders. ;)
- people don't like orders, don't try to ask things to someone who already doesn't like you, you may regret it...
- people who aren't your subordinate won't obey you automatically. They only do what they accept to do.
- subordinates may revolt if you push them to their limit
- be careful what you demand to who : if you make a caravaner or a mage wander around and he disappears, don't forget you may need his travelling services later...
- Slaves prefer when you let them wander alone.
- even a slave may revolt...
- Companions don't like to be left behind.

Others you'll find by yourself :)


*** WARNING ***


Giving orders is a great power. If you're archmage, you can bring an army of mages with you during your travels, and wreak havoc. I could have managed ways to limit things, but I prefer to let the player (you) judge of what is fun and what is unbalancing the game. After all, if you're the boss, you choose what is good or not for you, and for your game. ;)



*** About using Dracandros' voice AND my mod together ***


Some commands are common to the two mods : follow/stay/wander.
If you use the versions added by my mod, NPC will react, disposition will change, depending on the order.
If you use the versions added by DV, NPC won't care and disposition won't change.
Both sets of commands will be available at the same time, through two different topics.
So it's up to you to choose which version you'll prefer to use. If you want to roleplay with NPC, I would recommend using mine instead.



-----------------------------------------


What's new in version 1.1 :

- Reworked the dialogs interactions
- Corrected some interactions which could never occur
- Added the display of stats for subordinates and slaves
- Added the display of stats for NPC who like you on certain conditions
- Changed the original slave script to make classic slaves more efficient - scripts enhancements by Grumpy
- Added conditional spell boost to NPC to make them able to follow the player
- Some misc stuff and surprises... ;)

What's new in version 1.2 :

- I have set the modified date of the mod to 2030 to avoid any mod to bypass its slavescript
- Slaves will level-up with the player (stats and skills) BUT you won't see any level change in the stats display
- Followers can levitate or waterwalk like you through a dedicated dialogue option. Slaves are automatically using levitate or waterwalk to follow you, and they do follow very precisely :)
- you can ask info from higher rank faction members, but they don't like to be disturbed
- the mod automatically changes the "level" topic from Dracandros voice mod (if loaded) so it won't allow NPC to give you their level if you're not higher rank faction member or master (for a slave)
- some dialogues rework
- some bugs fixed (like speed of followers not coming back to normal when asked to wander)

What's new in version 1.3

- small bugs corrections
- optimized slave script, now speed boost works
- fun option : light on/off ;)
- added a trader to Suran slave market, selling expensive universal slave keys allowing you to take control of ANY slave, to free him or to keep him
- slaves now have the following spell effects launched at the same time as the player : levitate, waterwalk, chameleon, invisibility
- guards of your faction won't arrest you if you're head of the faction and doing "bad" things, but they may revolt seeing your actions, be careful !



You can overwrite old version, use old saves, no problem to fear.
